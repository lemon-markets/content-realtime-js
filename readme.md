# Live Streaming for üçã.markets

This is a small example about using the [live streaming API](https://docs.lemon.markets/live-streaming/overview) from [lemon.markets](https://lemon.markets/) using `node.js`.

## Quick Start

**NOTE:** This sample project works best with node.js v18+.

1. Open `index.js` and replace `YOUR-API-KEY` with your paper trading API key
2. Install the Ably SDK via `npm install`
3. Run the code via `node index.js`

You should see something like this:

```

If you pay close attention, you will notice updates to the data in the bottom line as your code receives new updates.
